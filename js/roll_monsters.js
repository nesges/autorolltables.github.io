"A fey dragon, giving it an attenuation to the feywild and an affinity to nature. It seems constantly surrounded by flowers and fairies and seems to be quite the trickster.",
"Loves building, and has actually tried to make its lair into the perfect dungeon. It will eagerly lure in and tempt people into it. It would even be excited if someone survived the entire dungeon.",
"Considers itself to be a mercenary hunting down either heroes or evildoers. It hunts down these people and fights them mercilessly.",
"Fond of meditation and has spent years reaching inner enlightenment and tranquillity.",
